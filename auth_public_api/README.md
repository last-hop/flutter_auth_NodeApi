## Flutter Application for GitHub User Search and Authentication

This Flutter application provides authentication functionalities using Firebase Authentication, allowing users to sign up, sign in, and recover their password. Additionally, the app utilizes the GitHub API to fetch real-time user data and avatars, enabling users to search for GitHub accounts based on their initials in real-time.

## Features

Firebase Authentication: Users can sign up using their name, email, and password, and sign in using their registered email and password. The app also includes a "Forget Password" option for password recovery, which sends a recovery link to the user's registered email.

GitHub API Integration: The app fetches real-time user data and avatars from the GitHub API, allowing users to search for GitHub accounts based on their initials. As the user types in the search bar, a list of users with matching initials is displayed in real-time.
## Usage
